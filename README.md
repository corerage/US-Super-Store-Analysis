## Data Exploration


## Exploratory Questions

In my analysis, I explore and answered the following questions:

1. What state had more sales and profit within the country?

2. What region had more sales and profit within the region?

3. What product gave rise to more sales within the store?

4. what was the percentage count of quantity sold per item?

5. What was the amount of the most sales made?

6. What period was profit at its lowest?

7. What was the highest discount given on a product?

8. What problems do you think insights from the data you generated could solve for Groceries or E-commerce companies in the country and how would you advise if it was an e-commerce company within the region covered.

9. Take a critical look at an E-commerce web platform and social media pages
From your understanding of business processes, What assumptions or insights would you make from the external overview of the platforms as it pertains to customers' patronage and engagements

10. How would you increase the companyâ€™s conversion rate per peradventure there is high churn?

11. If our hypothetical company is releasing a new feature or product into the market,
What would be your Top 3 metrics to define the success of the product?

12. What, why, and how would you choose the metrics?

13. How would you use Data to ensure the product is profitable?

# Conclusion

After answering the above questions, I was able to come to the conclusion that our company should look into what the sate of Califonia and New York is doing, and implement it in other states where they have their businesses to drive sale, focus more on stocking products like furniture, chairs, and chairmats as these products improve sales. Lastly, they should focus on developing their web platform to attract engagements from prospects and the deployment of a recommender systems to drive good shopping experience.
